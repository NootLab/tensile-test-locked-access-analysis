When Access database files are locked (password-protected or read-only)
you can view the data but cannot export it directly. 

Supports recovering test batches that were split across multiple files 
due to session interruptions or partial data recovery.

This tool lets you:
1. Copy column data in manageable chunks
2. Stitch together data from multiple Access files (if necessary)
3. Paste into the GUI
4. Process and visualize without needing full database access
