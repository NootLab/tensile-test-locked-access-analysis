The script will help you process and visualize the data without needing full database access.

Supports test batches that were split across multiple files 
due to session interruptions or partial data recovery.

How to use:
1. Copy column data in manageable chunks
2. Stitch together data from multiple Access files (if necessary)
3. Paste into the relevant fields of the GUI 
4. Process and visualize relevant charts 
5. Export as .csv
